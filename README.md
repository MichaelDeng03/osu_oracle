documentation? you wish...., no but fr its coming as soon as I figure out what im doing.
Database schema https://dbdiagram.io/d/osu-654e8e887d8bbd6465f40357 (or just look at data/classes.py)
dm me on reddit if you want a copy of the database @ u/EggTofu, or just make a copy of it yourself. Takes a while though.

To make a copy of it yourself: run scraping/scrape_users.py, scraping/scrape_users.py, scraping/scrape_maps.py in that order.

I may have messed up Models/ and Backend/ while fiddling with the database. I'll fix those soon.
