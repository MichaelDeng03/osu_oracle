# ðŸ”® osu!Oracle

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Until oAuth authentication with osu! is implemented, API credentials are stored in a file named `osu_access_token.py` which must be created in `data/` and `scraping/`.

An example file looks like the following:
```python
client_id = 13337
client_secret = "supersecretrandomstringfromosu"
```

## File structure

```bash
# Web application and user-input handling.

# Handy scripts to scrape osu! & store data.
