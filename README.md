### Training

osu!Oracle is based off of collaborative filtering via Item2Vec, implemented through Gensim's Word2Vec. User scores (beatmap-mod) are treated as words, and top scores are used to generate vector embeddings for each beatmap-mod. Predictions are made by clustering top scores (or any list of scores), and applying nearest neighbors to each cluster center. 

To train a model, use `Models/w2v_embeddings.ipynb`. Create a corpus consisting of [beatmap_id-mods, beatmap_id-mods, ... , beatmap_id-mods] for each player's top scores. Some mods are removed. Notably, NC and DT are combined into DT only, and mods such as SD are fully removed.

Train the word2vec model on this corpus, and save the model as `Models/w2v_model_x`. The currently deployed model has hyperparameters: vector_size=15, epochs=70, window=30, min_count=5, workers=16, sg=0, hs=0, negative=20, ns_exponent=0.9. No grid search or validation was performed, which is certainly a point of improvement.
