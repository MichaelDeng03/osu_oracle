# ðŸ”® osu!Oracle

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Until oAuth authentication with osu! is implemented, API credentials are stored in a file named `osu_access_token.py`, which must be created in either the base folder `/` with system path inserting `sys.path.insert(0, "../")` in each module that requires api access, or in `data/` and `scraping/`. API credentials may be generated in your osu! settings under OAuth.

An example file looks like the following:

```python
client_id = 13337
client_secret = "supersecretrandomstringfromosu"
```

## File structure

```bash
# Web application and user-input handling.
osu_oracle/

# Model training and saved models.
Models/

# Used to store osu! data w/ a notebook for creating the sqlite db schema. Also contains classes for mediating interactions between ossapi and the database.

# Handy scripts to scrape osu! & store data.

osu!Oracle is currently hosted live at osu-oracle.com.

### Data 

Database schema can be found here: <https://dbdiagram.io/d/osu-654e8e887d8bbd6465f40357>.

Please open an issue on github for a copy of the database, or scrape it yourself using the scripts provided in `/scraping.` `scrape_user_ids.py` will pull all ids from osu! leaderboards, `scrape_users.py` will pull all user data and top scores from those ids, and `scrape_maps.py` will pull all map data from the users' top 100 plays. Expect these scripts to run for about ~35hours in total due to osu! API rate limits.

### Training 

To train a model, use `Models/nearest_neighbors.ipynb`. Create a corpus consisting of [beatmap_id-mods, beatmap_id-mods, ... , beatmap_id-mods] for each player's top scores. Use noHD_removed_mods for training a model where all HD is removed, standard_removed_mods otherwise - this is useful for players who think HD is a preference mod. 

Then, train the model in the next notebook cell. The currently deployed model almost always has sg=0, hs=0, window=100, workers=16. I have experimented with different dimension vectors/training iterations. Typically, I find that overtraining is easy w/ available data - either train on low dimensions w/ higher iterations or high dimensions and low iterations. Refer to gensim docs for further information regarding parameter tuning. 

Save your trained model in the next cell. 

### Deployment

Osu Oracle is hosted using Flask, a lightweight web framework, Gunicorn, a Python WSGI server for handling requests, and Nginx, a web server and reverse proxy. Gunicorn and Nginx are not necessary for local development and model testing.

For local development, run `python3 app.py` after updating model names. The application can then be found at <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.
